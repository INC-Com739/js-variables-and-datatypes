# JavaScript Variables and Data Types

## Overview
This activity introduces JavaScript variables and data types. Students will learn how to declare variables using `let` and `const`, explore different data types, and practice modifying variable values.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, students should be able to:
- Understand the difference between `let` and `const`
- Identify and use different JavaScript data types
- Log variable values to the console for debugging

## Instructions
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open the `index.js` file in a code editor use 'go live'.
3. Open the browser's developer console (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`) and go to the "Console" tab.
4. Run the script and observe the logged output.
5. Modify the variables and see how the changes affect the console output.
6. Uncomment the `const` reassignment to observe the error.

## Code Example
Here’s a snippet of what you’ll be working with:

```javascript
// JavaScript Variables and Data Types

let name; // Declare a variable for a name
const age; // Declare a constant for an age
let isStudent; // Declare a boolean variable
let height; // Declare a number variable
let hobbies; // Declare an array
let address; // Declare an object

console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Is a student?", isStudent);
console.log("Hobbies:", hobbies);
```

## Challenges
- Can you add '2' + 2? What is the error that you see in the console?
- Create an object representing yourself with properties like `name`, `age`, and `favoriteFoods`.
- Experiment with different data types and log them to the console.
